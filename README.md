This repository dedicates to summarizing the coding questions I have done. This includes:
1. notes for the topic/algorithm
2. explanation for my code
3. code 

The purposes of creating and updating this repository:
1. **Note keeping**: As I'm preparing for technical interviews and improving my programming skills, I would like to organize my notes well for easy access in the future. I will likely forget the strategies I took for some questions I had done in the past, so I want to keep my notes and thought processes available at hand.
2. **Motivation**: When working at home, I always lose my motivation to study and work. I usually would feel more obligated to work when I have something to show in public, so I decided to keep up an online repository. 
3. **Share my ideas and explanations**: It is very challenging for me to explain a topic or idea to someone else, so I would want to take this opportunity to practice my communication skill. I believe I can also have a more thorough understanding of the questions as I'm working on the explanation.
